# FCN

General JAX implementation of a fully convolutional network (FCN). General means that you can easily modify number of resolutions, convolutional layers per resolution, batch normalizations, and dropout layers to create your own architecture.

## To-do

- [ ] improve early stopping to watch 2 or more metrics at once
